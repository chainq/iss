iNQ Sound Server
================

This is the public GitHub mirror of the Inquisition Sound Server
SVN repository.

These are the Free Pascal sources of a MOD/XM musicplayer I wrote
more than a decade ago. Currently, only GO32V2 (Gravis Ultrasound
and Sound Blaster) and OS/2 EMX (Gravis Ultrasound and DART) is
supported, but I plan to add support for more platforms.

Scattered over my computers, code exist to support Amiga, Amiga/AHI,
and Linux/ALSA outputs at least. These all will be eventually
gathered and added to the SVN repo.

The sources are based on version 0.2.1 which was the last public
version released. These sources were originally published at:

Why SVN?
--------

Nowadays I use Amiga and MorphOS for my hobby and fun programming.
These systems still lack a good git port sadly, so I went with SVN.
The GitHub git mirror is provided for convenience and because the
additional tools GitHub provides.
