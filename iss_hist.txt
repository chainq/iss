   0.2.1       þ SECOND OFFICIAL RELEASE - Codename "Yavin"
               þ Thanks for Zoom/INQ and TCC/INQ for test hardware support.
               + OS/2 support added.
               + OS/2 support added to INQPlay and ISSPlay.
               + Native OS/2 GUS support using the Manley drivers API added.
               + DART (OS/2 Warp Direct Audio RouTines) support added.
               þ THE OS/2 SUPPORT IS STILL IN ALPHA STAGE. HANDLE WITH CARE.
               + Platform ID numbers and Strings added to ISS_VAR.PAS.
               + Some preliminary code added for upcoming Win32/DirectSound
                 and Linux/OSS support. Note that the drivers still not
                 included in the release version, so do not enable these
                 in ISS_SET.INC.
               + Some preliminary code added for upcoming MOD and S3M
                 support. Note that the loaders still not included in the
                 release version, so do not enable these in ISS_SET.INC.
               * GUS driver volume handling reworked. The new volume table
                 is calculated at init time, the two older volume tables
                 removed. So the driver is somewhat smaller now.
               * ISS_CCVoicePos device command removed. The system now uses
                 ISS_CCStop+ISS_CCSample+ISS_CCVolume commands to have the
                 same result as ISS_CCVoice had. This simplifies channel
                 handling in devices.
               * Since a device command removed, numerical values of device
                 commands changed. This was done to keep the code clean.
               * Got rid of those Boolean() bit flag checks, and replaced
                 with =0 and >0 checks. The compiler generates faster and
                 smaller code from this.
               * Some internal changes around sample handling.
               * System changes around initalization and shutdown. Check
                 the example players. (ISS_Init and ISS_Done now must be
                 called by the user program.)
               * Device driver interface changed. A new driver callback
                 named 'Done' added to allow the system to have more control
                 on devices. This was heavily needed under multi-tasking
                 environments. Stay tuned for more changes...
               - No more compiler warnings, when debug mode enabled, and
                 the CODER environment variable not set.
               - ISS_AutoSetup always returned False. (Stupid bug...) Fixed.
               - XMs using patterns with too many (256) rows crashed the
                 player. Fixed. (This was fixed once in 0.1.5, but it
                 appeared again in 0.2.0.) Thanks for Sergey Kosarevsky
                 for the bugreport.
               - Mixer's sample loading routine crashed with zero byte
                 length loops. Fixed. Thanks fly out to Sergey Kosarevsky
                 for sending an example file showed the problem.
               - Sound Blaster Pro playback problems (too big time constants)
                 fixed. Thanks to Aleksey V. Vaneev, for reporting this
                 problem.
               - DMA page locking failed under CWSDPMI with compiler
                 version 1.0.4, so page locking removed. Anyway, this is
                 only a temporary solution for this problem... Thanks to
                 Matti Hamalainen for the bugreport.
                 [2000.june.29]

   0.2.0       þ FIRST OFFICIAL RELEASE - Codename "Coruscant"
               þ Thanks for Zoom/INQ and Innocent/INQ for test hardware
                 support.
               þ WARNING! API CHANGED! Check the example players.
               + Added _ISS_LOAD_NOFILEMODE_ directive to disable file
                 functions in the module loader subsystem. This results in
                 a lot smaller soundsystem, and allows easier integration
                 into 64k intros. Don't forget to use smartlinking, when
                 using this directive to avoid linking of file-handler
                 routines. Your executable will be a lot smaller in this way.
               + Added _ISS_LOAD_IDSMODE_ directive to allow an easier way
                 to integrate the player into iNQ Demo System's fileloader
                 subsystem. Members of other teams should not use it... ;)
               + ISS_DoneModulePlay function added. (ISS_PLAY.PAS)
               + ISS_FreeSample function added. (ISS_SYS.PAS)
               + Instrument Name display added to INQPlay.
               + Panning slide rigth and left (volume column) effects added.
               + Full Sound Blaster 2.x/Pro/16 support added. (STILL BETA)
                 I sucked a LOT with the SB code, and i did it ONLY due to
                 public demand. I haven't changed my mind, and working with
                 SBs only made knowledge from my belief, namely SB is the
                 WORST hardware, what i've ever seen... (This also applies
                 to the DMA controller of the PC, congrats Intel...)
                 Also note that the SB driver DOES NOT support Sound Blaster
                 1.0 and clones, since these ancient cards doesn't support
                 autoinit DMA mode, which is currently required. If you need
                 this limitation to be removed, write an email to me.
                 Anyway, the historical date, when the player first produced
                 correct sound on a SoundBlaster card was 24. december. 2000
                 01:09 am. ;) The card was an ancient non-PnP SB16. Cool eh?
               + A 32bit software mixer added. It's buggy, it's VERY slow,
                 but mostly works. It will be much better in future releases.
                 Use GUS anyway. ;)
               * New copyright headers to match the style with the rest of
                 our demo system.
               * ISS_Done is no longer required to be called, because it is
                 called by the new function ISS_DoneModulePlay;
               * Slow nosound driver is back.
               * GUS driver modifications for less ultraclicks. I'm now using
                 nearly the same way to start/stop a sample as Open Cubic
                 Player does. So it sounds pretty well i think. Anyway it's
                 a lot slower than the old way, but still acceptable.
                 At least the processors getting faster... ;)
               * Timer advancements. Rewritten IRQ routine in Intel assembly.
                 No longer requires GNU AS to compile.
               - Player timing was buggy at high BPM rates. Fixed.
               - Playback was buggy using instruments with empty (zero
                 length) samples. Fixed.
               - GUS driver no longer detects GUS, when ULTRASND environment
                 variable set, but there is no hardware installed.
               - Autovibrato depth calculation was buggy. Fixed.
                 [date:2001.march.01]

   0.1.9       þ INTERNAL ONLY, NEVER RELEASED.
               þ Codename was "Hoth"... Guess why... :)
                 (Check out the changes above.)

   0.1.8HV     þ CONFERENCE 7007 Party at Debrecen/Hungary (2000.10.27-29)
                 We released our demo, called High Voltage, and we won.
                 The demo works with ISS 0.1.8, but with Autovibrato fixed.
                 Sadly i had no time to finish the new 0.1.9 version before
                 the party, because i still had work on our video system,
                 (IVS) and on other parts of the system code. After the
                 party many people asked for the Sound Blaster version.
                 It has higher priority now.
                 [date:29.october.2000]

   0.1.8       þ TEST RELEASE 10 - Codename "Bespin"
               þ The Sound Blaster driver and the mixer are NOT included in
                 this release. There were many changes in both mixer and SB
                 code, and neither of them are stable now, so i removed them.
                 Both will be back in 0.2.0, with full mixer and SB support.
               * Heavy internal changes in the effect processing. The effect
                 selection mechanism now uses tables instead of huge CASE
                 structures. This makes future improvements more easy, and
                 also should be much faster. (ISS_PLAY.PAS, ISS_PLFX.PAS)
               * GUS driver now uses a new volume table. This one sounds much
                 better in my opinion. However, if you like the old one, you
                 still can switch it back in ISS_SET.INC.
               * Linear Frequency Table replaced with a new one. (The one
                 from Judas Soundsystem, hehe. ;-) This sounds much better.
               + ISS_Done procedure implemented to free up internal system
                 memory areas when they are no longer required. (ISS_SYS.PAS)
                 ISS_Done procedure should be last called procedure from ISS.
                 As always, check the example programs.
               + Instrument Autovibrato support added. (Sine vibrato only!)
               - Envelope loop and sustain conflicted sometimes. Fixed.
               - Mode switching bugs in INQPlay fixed. (Thanks for
                 Innocent/iNQ for machine support.)
               - Instrument initialization was buggy with delay note effect.
                 I did a workaround, but I'm not sure the problem 100% gone.
               - XM loader didn't loaded Autovibrato values. Fixed.
               - Some Vibrato bugs fixed.
               - Finetune calculation was buggy. Fixed.
               - Note start was buggy with portamento to note effect. Fixed.
                 Thanks for mrc!/iNQ for the bugreport.
               - KeyOff was conflicted with instrument init. Fixed.
               - Envelope position calc. was buggy, when there was too big
                 difference between envelope points. Fixed.
               - IRQ number detection was wrong in SB driver. Fixed.
               - Nosound driver didn't closed the mixer in slow mode. Fixed.
               - Note cut effect was buggy. Fixed.
               - Some other minor corrections and fixes.
                 [date:07.august.2000]

   0.1.7       þ TEST RELEASE 09 - Codename "Corelia"
               * WARNING! There are _HUGE_ amount of internal changes in this
                 release! The API changed too! See the example players.
               * Device driver and loader initalization removed from the
                 units' startup code, and implemented as a function call.
                 Check ISS_SYS.PAS for ISS_InitSystem.
               + 16bit sample limitation removed from the system, it's now
                 possible to use full-quality samples. Anyway the 8bit sample
                 limitation still exists in the GUS driver, so the driver
                 will convert the samples to 8bit before loading into the
                 card. But now this happens transparently to the user program
                 and it will be possible to use 16bit samples in the mixer
                 and so. This modification removed the crash/leak bug from
                 ISS_FreeModule function, so it's recommended to use this
                 function to free up the module RAM after playing stopped.
                 As usual, check the example programs for proper usage.
               + Some basic code for the upcoming mixer and Sound Blaster
                 support. (ISS_MIX.PAS, ISS_SB.PAS) SB now works as a
                 second slow-nosound device.
               + From now on there are two modes for the nosound device.
                 The slow mode is for players, it uses the mixer, so VU
                 meters and such things are updated correctly. The fast
                 mode is the old version, it only does the most necessary
                 things. It's useful for time critical areas such demos/
                 intros/games. The mode is set in compile-time with a symbol
                 (_ISS_NSND_SLOWMODE_) definied in file ISS_SET.INC.
               - Envelope initalization was wrong in some cases. Fixed.
               - Sample number calculations fix in version 0.1.5 introduced
                 another problem: XM's using instruments with no samples
                 crashed the system. Fixed.
               - The soundsystem didn't checked if a sample is 0 byte length
                 before starting the sample. Fixed.
               - Ooops, main tracker routine (ISSPlay_PeriodicProc, in
                 ISS_PLAY.PAS) was wrong. An endless loop requires Until
                 False not Until True of course. Unfortunately, this
                 problem hasn't showed up, since the GUS and the nosound
                 driver don't require an endless loop in the tracker code,
                 because their fast timing. But the mixer code is another
                 thing... Anyway, now it's fixed.
               - Module title now stored as a string, because FPC is buggy
                 with writeln(array[] of char)... This eliminates bugs from
                 module title output in the eg. player.
               - Removed the three column of numbers from the eg. player. It
                 was some vibrato debug code, which i forgot to remove. ;)
                 [date:07.june.2000]

   0.1.6       þ TEST RELEASE 08 - Codename "Mon Calamari"
               + Player global volume support.
               + Set global volume command added. (Gxy)
               + Global volume slide command added. (Hxy)
               + Vibrato command added. (4xy) Sine waveform only!
               + Vibrato support added to command Vibrato+Volumeslide.(6xy)
               + Example player changes: displays player global volume,
                 now knows more effect names and shows effect names on
                 inactive channels too.
               + ISS_FreeModule function now implemented. Check ISS_LOAD.PAS.
                 It's still leaky and/or crash in case of 16bit samples.
                 Do _NOT_ use it. This bug will disappear in the next release
                 after some internal changes.
               * ISS_GlobalVolume variable renamed to ISS_GlobalSSVolume.
               * Changes in the internal module format for better error
                 handling.
               - Delay Note bugfix. Thanks for Innocent/iNQ for his help.
               - XM loader was buggy with modules containing 0 byte length
                 (empty) patterns. Fixed.
               - Guess what? GUS driver modifications for less Ultraclicks!
                 :) Thanks for Nobo/Chrysalis for his help.
                 [date:05.may.2000]

   0.1.5       þ TEST RELEASE 07 - Codename "Kessel"
               þ This is mainly a bugfix release.
               þ Thanks for KiD/iNQ, who tested the player and reported a
                 lot of bugs.
               + The example player now got a special multitasker-support
                 feature. You can switch it on with button M. Tested under
                 OS/2 Warp 4 successfully. Probably works under Linux
                 dosEmu too. _NOT_ under Windows 9x. Sorry.
               - Volume slide was buggy when parameter 00. Fixed.
               - Delay note was buggy when no note specified. Fixed.
               - Sample number calculations was wrong with instruments
                 using more than one sample. Fixed.
               - XMs using patterns with too many (256) rows crashed the
                 player. Fixed.
               - Again some GUS driver modifications for less Ultracliks.
                 I think the player now has pretty less clicks, even some
                 famous and wide-spread players has more. (Just listen a
                 silent song with XTCPlay, and you'll know what i'm
                 talking about...) This especially belongs to GUS Classic.
                 On GUS PnP it produces even much less clicks.
               - Some GUS driver fixes. Sample begin address calculation
                 was wrong. Fixed.
                 [date:18.april.2000]

   0.1.4       þ TEST RELEASE 06 - Codename "Star's End"
               + Portamento+VolumeSlide (5xy) command added.
               + Delay Note command added.
               + Volume Envelope support added.
               + Panning Envelope support added.
               + It's now possible to change the music position using the
                 arrow keys in the example player.
               + System-level support for manual change the music position.
               + Pattern Jump command added.
               * Internal structure format changed from packed to word
                 aligned. This means some speedup.
               * Changes in the internal module format. This was necessary
                 for envelope-support.
               * Minor changes and changes and enhancements in the UI of
                 the example player, such hexadecimal display, etc.
               - Smartlinking was impossible due a limitation in the timer
                 unit. Fixed. (Reported by Surgi/Terror Opera)
               - Nosound driver fixed to update virtualchannels correctly.
               - Some fixes around SetSampleOffset and Retrig command.
               - XM loader fixes. Now can load modules without pattern data.
                 An empty pattern also created to avoid player crashes.
                 This also fixes problems with XMs which have "phantom"
                 patterns in the order table.
               - Again GUS driver bugfixes. SampleEnd and LoopEnd values
                 hopefully correct now. This means less bugs in the sound,
                 and also less Ultraclicks. Some speedup too.
                 [date:14.april.2000]

   0.1.3       + The example player now displays most of the effects.
               - _HUGE_ amount of GUS driver bugfixes. Now hopefully works
                 correctly on GUS Classics too. As a side-effect, you can
                 expect less Ultraclicks. But the driver also slower a bit
                 now. :(
               * Some internal modifications. (VChControl Flags)
                 [date:04.april.2000]

   0.1.2       * XMs using Amiga periods now supported, but using linear
                 periods. However, it seems they play correctly.
               + Basic things for instrument support added.
               + Volume Fadeouts added.
               + Keyoff support added.
               - Filemode bugfix for opening read-only files.
               * GUS driver optimizations. Less UltraClicks(TM), more speed.
                 [date:02.april.2000]
               * The GUS driver now uses much less CPU time.
               - 16bit sample bug workaround. 16bit samples now converted
                 to 8bit while loading. This is because I could not find any
                 programming info for GUS using 16bit samples. The GUS SDK
                 is also buggy with 16bit samples. :(
               + No sound driver now updates virtual devchannels.
                 [date:29.march.2000]
               + Example player got some kind of UI and some visual display.
               - Retrig note bug fixed. (Reported & requested by BiP/iNQ)
               + Panning support added. (Requested by Innocent/iNQ)
               + SetPanning command added.
               + SetVolumePanning command added.
                 [date:20.march.2000]

   0.1.1       * Volume slide now optimized for less CPU overhead.
               - Buggy note calculations fixed (Reported by Tcc/iNQ).
               - SetSampleOffset effect was buggy. Fixed.

   0.1.0       þ Lot's of bugs fixed, lot's of features added, since the
                 last update in this history, the player progressing well,
                 it's stable, however it still lacks some features like
                 instruments, and most of the effects. Anyway, i'm happy
                 with it and i sent out some example versions for testing.
                 [date:08.march.2000]
               þ Now, the first song was properly played by the player.
                 It was the 'Boci-boci tarka' a hungarian child-song.
                 Special remix made by me. :) Don't miss this masterpiece,
                 you can found it under the name boczee.xm. :)
                 [date:07.february.2000, time.06:27.am]
               þ Today, the brand new rewritten soundsystem first produced
                 some static sound. This means, my new GUS driver works, but
                 still requires some bugfixing. :) Anyway, i'm happy with
                 the results, and it seems i can reach my target.
                 [date:22.january.2000]
               þ I wasn't ready, so our new demo called High Voltage is
                 delayed until Conference 7007. :(
               þ Beginning of a major reorganization, rewriting and optimi-
                 zation. I hope i'll be ready until Conference 3000.
